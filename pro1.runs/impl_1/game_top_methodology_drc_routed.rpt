TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk60hz_reg/C, clk_counter_reg[0]/C, clk_counter_reg[10]/C,
clk_counter_reg[11]/C, clk_counter_reg[12]/C, clk_counter_reg[17]/C,
clk_counter_reg[18]/C, clk_counter_reg[19]/C, clk_counter_reg[1]/C,
clk_counter_reg[20]/C, clk_counter_reg[2]/C, clk_counter_reg[3]/C,
